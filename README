INTRO:

    no2id is to be migrating its httpds over to nginx.

    We're not idiots. We do stuff as root: none of that 'sudo' bollix.

    We're talking about lazy sysadmins, who like scripts to make
    things easier.

    Hence these.

    These should be checked-out, on each machine, to /root/build, 
    and from there, run.


TO DO:
    -   auto-discover the latest stable version, and supply that
        as VERSION (in bin/{nginx-installer,vcheck-nginx}); (maybe)

    -   convert (the once) Apache configs over to nginx

    -   update an audit log, of build, really.

FILES:
    bin/nginx-installer:        download, config, build, and create 
                                init.d scripts for nginx

    bin/nginx-vhost:            lazily make a generic config file for
                                a specified vhost, hopefully not doing
                                Anything Bad.

    bin/patch-php-for-nginx:    make PHP 'safer', with nginx. Patch
                                the /etc/php5/*/php.ini files, per
                                the patch. With a script, to check &c.
    
    bin/php-fcgi:               init.d script for spawning php as an
                                FCGI, based on the Debian skeleton,
                                and cludged via the ideas in
                                http://wiki.nginx.org/PHPFcgiExample.

    bin/release-finder:         look for new releases, rather messily.
                                note VER at line 15.

    bin/vcheck-nginx:           wrap-around-script for release-finder; to
                                be run from cron, most likely

    patches/php5-cgi.fix_pathinfo.patch:    patch to set 
                                            'cgi.fix_pathinfo=0' in 
                                            php.ini files, per the
                                            Pitfalls of Nginx.

DONE:
    X   script to check for newer (stable) versions of nginx

CHECKOUT/PULL:
    As root, in /root:
        mkdir build
        git clone git://github.com/no2id/nginx-no2id.git

    Committers, once you've added your key(s):
        cd ~/whereever
        git clone git@github.com:no2id/nginx-no2id.git

    Make changes in your repo, commit, and push, then as root, one may
        cd /root/build/nginx-no2id && git pull
    to update.
