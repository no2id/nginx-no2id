INTRO:

    no2id is to be migrating its httpds over to nginx. 

    We're not idiots. We do stuff as root: none of that 'sudo' bollix.

    We're talking about lazy sysadmins, who like scripts to make
    things easier.

    Hence these.

    These should be checked-out, on each machine, to /root/build, 
    and from there, run.


TO DO:
    -   auto-discover the latest stable version, and supply that
        as VERSION;

    -   convert (the once) Apache configs over to nginx

    -   update an audit log, of build, really.

FILES:
    bin/nginx-installer :   download, config, build, and create 
                            init.d scripts for nginx

    bin/release-finder  :   look for new releases, rather messily.
                            note VER at line 15.

    bin/vcheck-nginx    :   wrap-around-script for release-finder; to
                            be run from cron, most likely

DONE:
    X   script to check for newer (stable) versions of nginx
